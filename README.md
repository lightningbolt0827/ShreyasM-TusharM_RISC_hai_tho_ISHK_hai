# Colorimeter
## Introduction
A colorimeter is a laboratory device used to measure the absorbance of light at specific wavelengths in a given solution. The fundamental principle behind colorimetry is Beer-Lambert’s law, which states that the amount of light absorbed by a colored solution is directly proportional to the solution’s concentration and the length of the light path through it. When light passes through a sample solution, part of it is absorbed, while the remaining light is transmitted. By comparing the color intensity of a solute in the sample solution to that of a reference solution with a known solute concentration, we can estimate the concentration of the colored solute in the sample. Colorimeters are commonly used in fields such as water analysis, environmental analysis, and laboratory research1.
